An Overview of Implementation

I decided to use SwiftUI for this test, since that is your preferred methodology.
It's also nice to get to use it more extensively, as many of the projects I work
on for my day job use much older archetecture. If necessary though I can also use
storyboards (the splash screen is storyboarded) or autolayout code in Swift and
(heaven forfend!) Objective C.

You may notice that the API implementation is rather elaborated, given how simple
the API provided is. This is intentional. It makes the project easier to modify and
adapt going forward, were we to implement further functionality. However, I did
think that the API was peculiar in that it did not use the standard method for
providing parameters. I included this in the API Request structure too, just in
case and because it's a quick and easy addition.

When implementing the list of dog breeds, I noticed that the API actually provides
both breeds and sub-breeds. With this in mind, I created a hierarchic structure
rather than a flat one. A breed with associated sub-breeds has a darker disclosure
arrow rather than a light one. Breed entries can still be tapped in order to view
general images, but it is also possible to expand the sub-breeds associated with
it and select a specific sub-breed.

I also implemented a simple alphabetic sorting and sectioning system, since there
are a lot of entries in the list and this makes them easier to search through
manually.

Finally, I added a search box for extra speed. This filters the list, retaining
only those breeds whose name contains the entered text, and those with a sub-breed
that matches the text. In the latter case, only matching sub-breeds are
shown in the disclosure.

I also drew up a quick app icon and splash screen. I can't stand having an app with
no proper branding! I designed the image myself using Affinity Designer; I'm using
vector-based PDFs for optimum file size and scalability.
